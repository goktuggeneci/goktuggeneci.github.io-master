They are usually pen shaped; the user inhales the vaporized liquid from one end the devise. These liquids contain nicotine, glycol, glycerin, propylene, and flavorings.

           <p>    The inventor of the electronic cigarette was a Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik, who patented it in 2003. The following year Lik introduced the electronic cigarette to the Chinese market. While numerous companies are taking great interest in this product as are many consumers around the world. Smoking an E-Cigarette or “vaping” is getting significantly popular, raising concerns regarding health risks like the possibility that the vapor being created by the device contains harmful chemicals.<p>
             <p>    “The lithium battery powers the e-cigarette and can be charged using a charger similar to those used for cell phone batteries. The charged battery is connected to the vaporization chamber, a hollow tube that contains electronic controls and an atomizer -- the component that creates the vapor. Before the user activates the device, he or she attaches a cartridge containing nicotine liquid to the vaporization chamber. The tip of the cartridge serves as the e-cigarette's mouthpiece.” –Cassidy.<p>
